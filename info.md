# INDIA
The socio economic problem in india is over population, economic issue (poverty, sanitation, corruption, Education and violence (naxalism, religious, caste related and terrorism). Socioeconomic factors are the social and economic experiences and realities that help mold one's personality, attitudes, and lifestyle. The factors can also define regions and neighborhoods. Law-enforcement agencies throughout the country, for example, often cite the socioeconomic factor of poverty as being related to areas with high crime rates. 1. Worsening Water Nightmare :-
India is facing the worst water crisis in history. Nearly half the population is struggling with drought-like conditions. This year, rainfall in western and southern states is below average.
The NITI Aayog has warned that the demand for drinking water will outstrip supply by 2030 if preventive steps are not taken.
Nearly 600 million Indians suffer from high to extreme water stress. About 2,00,000 deaths per year are attributed to lack of access to safe water. Experts predict that 21 big cities will run out of groundwater by 2021.
Solutions :-
a) There has been a large scale promotion and installation of rain water harvesting systems by the government.
b)The involvement of Center and State to deciding the proper cropping pattern which should be water resilient.
c) Long term projects such as river linking project are taken at a greater pace
d) Constant supply of water trucks in water scarce areas.
Problem 2. Agricultural problems :-
Let's first know what a farmer needs-

1)Capital(loans)
2)Seeds
3)Fertilisers and soil quality
4)Market and accessibility
5)storage units
6)Labour(not necessary)
7)Agricultural implement or tools
8)And compensation in any emergency
9)Profit margins
10)Resources like water and electricity
solutions :-
a) For electricity government introduced Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana. This is  scheme designed to provide continuous power supply to rural India. The government plans to invest ₹756 billion for rural electrification under this scheme.
b) Pradhan matri fasal bima yojana provides a insurance on crops a farmer grow.
c) Soil Health Card scheme enables farmer to get their soil checked and modified according to their need and increase production of crop.
d) In skill india govt also provides vocational education to farmers and also organises several seminars
e) Government also provide loan and credit to farmers at low interest rate and many schemes for storage has been taken into discussion and initiatives Problem 3. Unemployment :- India's unemployment rate stood at 8.1 per cent as of June 25, 2019, according to data released by Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).
It is also official that India's unemployment rate has touched a 45-year high, spelling more trouble for the Narendra Modi government, which promised to create one crore jobs every year since 2014 when it first came to power.
Meanwhile, the World Bank said India needs to create 8.1 million jobs annually to achieve its growth targets.
solutions :- a) SECTOR-SPECIFIC FOCUS- Currently, sectors like auto, real estate, banking, construction, agriculture and MSMEs - all of which contribute a considerable amount towards India's GDP - are facing a sharp demand slowdown.
The government is starting this project  by identifying such sectors, chalking out practical investment plans and reducing compliance burden to help in their recuperation, according to experts.
b) Economists have also advised the government to not only address the funding crisis but also ease land acquisition rules and initiate labour reforms initially for such sectors.
Reducing corporate tax, easing lending norms and relaxing GST rules on a short-term basis are some of the reforms that could give companies more room for hiring and boosting productivity. c) STATE-WISE JOB MONITORING - the government is increasing the cooperation with states to monitor job growth. They are trying to pinpoint the issues by comparing states that have recorded higher job growth than others.Economists have often advised the government to monitor such state-wise data and find out why some states offer lower employment opportunities. d) STRUCTURAL REFORMS, SKILL DEVELOPMENT - Besides a proper mechanism to identify job creation, the government is also trying to implement structural reforms to boost competition among businesses while maintaining a favorable environment. Structural reforms to boost "ease of doing business" will also play a key role in creating a conducive environment for businesses. The government is also providing short-term tax concessions and ease GST rules to support employment-generating sectors as well. e) QUELLING GENDER EMPLOYMENT GAP - The government is introducing reforms to quell the wage gap and get more women to become a part of the country's workforce. 'Mahila-E-Haat' Under the purview of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the government launched Mahila-E-Haat in 2016. It is a bilingual online marketing platform that leverages technology to help aspiring women entrepreneurs, self-help groups, and NGOs to showcase their products and services.
Open to all Indian women above the age of 18, this platform offers an easy sign-in process and convenient payment modes. Everything can be handled on a mobile with no other intervention required. The portal claims to have attracted 17 lakh visitors since its launch and features over 2,000 products and services across 18 categories from 24 states.
Problem 4. Lack of Education :-Illiteracy is one of the biggest problems of our country .
and to solve this problem ,our Indian government is taking several steps. such as,


1) Giving scholarships to the meritorious students.

2) Offering free of cost education in the government schools and colleges.

3) Offering free of cost mid-day meal in the government schools.

4) Arranging campaigns to promote the importance of education.

5) Establishing initiatives like the "Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan".

And many more.


# USA
Problem 1. The economy -
solution - a) To effectively respond to the coronavirus recession, U.S. policymakers are keeping the  income flow and are pausing the expenses for individuals and businesses, ensuring they are ready to get back to work once the health crisis passes.
b) Boost unemployment insurance - Congress is increasing the amount of unemployment insurance benefits and ensuring that it reaches everyone―the unemployed, those whose hours are cut, and the many gig workers who make our economy run. States are encouraging firms to adopt work sharing, a policy that allows employers to reduce hours rather than cutting jobs and is particularly effective when the reduction in demand is temporary. Problem 2. Health Care -
solution - a) Healthcare Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (HCQIA)
The Healthcare Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) provides immunity for medical professionals and institutions during conduct assessments. [1] The law originated partially due to a Supreme Court ruling involving abuse of the physician peer review process. To date, HCQIA continues to evolve as the act arises in courtrooms and justices deliver new rulings. Legislators enacted the law to protect medical professionals from peer review-related lawsuits and to encourage physicians to file official complaints after encountering unprofessional and dangerous peer conduct.
b) Medicare
The Medicare program provides insurance coverage for almost 50-million American citizens. In 1945, President Harry Truman rallied Congress for funding to insure all United States citizens. Twenty years later, president John F. Kennedy finally succeeded in providing coverage for U.S. senior citizens. Today, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the program will survive indefinitely thanks to sweeping spending reforms.
c) Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
Along with the Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) has created a strong foundation for delivering health coverage to children living in low-income households. The program originated with the Children’s Health Insurance Authorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) and has successfully provided services to many previously disqualified clients. The program has an extensive history of providing insurance to underprivileged children and receives funding from respective states and the federal government. Today, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) makes this service accessible to the largest number of low-income children in the country’s history. d) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects America workers by allowing them to carry health insurance policies from job to job.  The program also permits workers to apply to a select group of health insurance plans to replace lost coverage and adjust for family changes such as marriages, births and adoptions.
e) Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)
The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), an Affordable Care Act initiative, requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reduce payouts to care facilities that experience excessive patient readmissions.  The program launched in late 2012 and defines readmissions as ‘repeat patient admissions among participating CMS hospitals in a 30-day period; allowing exceptions for specific conditions, such as heart failure and pneumonia, as well as factors such as poor health and multiple illnesses.’
f) Affordable Care Act of 2010
The act requires most U.S. citizens to apply for health insurance coverage, levying a penalty for individuals who fail to secure insurance but making exceptions for a few protected groups. Under the law, enterprises that employ more than 200 workers must provide health insurance coverage. The act also established the American Health Benefits Exchange, where citizens can review and compare insurance plans.
The Affordable Care Act offers health care professionals the opportunity to participate in shaping the delivery of patient services. The medical field can benefit from input that helps deliver better services to the growing patient population while reducing care expenses. As a current or future decision maker in the health care field, care providers must reflect on how to create these results at their respective workplaces.
g) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects America workers by allowing them to carry health insurance policies from job to job.  The program also permits workers to apply to a select group of health insurance plans to replace lost coverage and adjust for family changes such as marriages, births and adoptions.
h) Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (PSQIA) of 2005
The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (PSQIA) protects health care workers who report unsafe conditions. Legislators created the law to encourage the reporting of medical errors, while maintaining patients’ confidentially rights. To ensure patient privacy, the HHS levies fines for confidentially breaches. The law also authorizes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to publish a list of patient safety organizations (PSOs) that record and analyze patient safety data. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces the law among national health care facilities.

# Japan
1) Low birth rate =>
The fact of the matter: the elderly population is on the rise, and people are not having enough children to keep the population balanced and steady. [image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/735904159093489705/739367812782489640/Japanese_fertility_rate.png) (a) childcare services : Beginning in 1994, the Government has implemented a
succession of programmes designed to provide more
childcare services and encourage the workplace to become
more family friendly. The number of places available in daycare centres and the number of children enrolled have both
increased since 2000, but the number of children on waiting
lists has also gone up. This suggests that the demand for
childcare services is growing faster than the supply. In
particular, there is an acute shortage of childcare services in
large metropolitan areas.
(b) parental leave schemes : Beginning in 1992, the Government has offered 12 months of
parental leave for parents who meet minimum work
requirements. Income compensation was added in 1995 and
is now paid at 50 per cent of monthly salary prior to the
beginning of leave. Japan’s parental leave scheme has major
shortcomings, however, including limited coverage, relatively
low level of income compensation and, most importantly, lack
of legally binding authority. A substantial proportion of
employers have not formulated specific policies regarding
parental leave, especially among small organizations.
(c)  monetary assistance in the form of child allowances : Launched in 1972, a child allowance scheme initially covered
third and higher-order children in households with incomes below a certain threshold. The duration of payment was from
a child’s birth to graduation from junior high school. Since
then, although still income tested, the scheme has been
expanded to cover first and second births. The amount of the
allowance has also increased, although it is still relatively small
compared with levels offered in Western Europe.

2) Gender inequality => Political representation is a key area for improvement: Japan currently ranks among the worst 10 performers in the index in terms of political empowerment. Japan has never had a female head of state, and female representation in parliament is one of the lowest in the world, at just 10%, it is 20% below the average share across advanced economies. In addition, there is currently only one woman in the 18-member cabinet, a decline from recent years.
The country has also struggled to significantly narrow its economic gender gap. Only 15% of senior and leadership positions are held by women, and income for women in Japan is about half that of men on average.
One reason for this economic disparity is that women in Japan spend more than four times as much time as men on unpaid domestic work, which means less time to engage in paid labour or work longer hours, which could hold women back from career opportunities and advancements. [image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/735904159093489705/739374916062674944/japan_men_and_women.png) solutions=>
(a) Increasing political representation -  More women in positions of political decision-making are creating a role model effect that could encourage more women to enter politics and leadership roles. Countries with higher levels of women in political power have also been found to have higher levels of women in business leadership. (b) Policies and incentives for increasing parity across the economy is also helping. These include quotas, targets for wage equity and updated family policies that support men and women – and ensure that uptake is more equally distributed across fathers and mothers.
(c) Businesses are also taking the lead to create inclusive workplaces with diverse hiring and promotion practices, as well as flexible, family-friendly policies. They are committing to wage equality and pursuing practices that enable women to access career opportunities and advancements.
(d) Leaders are focusing on steps to equip women with in-demand skills. By 2022, 42% of core skills required to perform existing jobs are expected to change, as the Fourth Industrial Revolution transforms economies and the workplace. Both political and corporate leaders are focus on reskilling, upskilling and educational opportunities to empower more women to fill the fastest-growing roles in the new economy, including those in data, artificial intelligence, engineering and cloud computing.
Economic problems in Japan => 1) To spur growth, the Bank of Japan keeps interest rates low. Its discount rate is just 0.3%. It promises that rates will remain low. People expect low rates and falling prices. That expectation guarantees deflation. In 2018, prices only rose by 1% according to the International Monetary Fund. That's the highest level in years. In 2016, prices fell -0.1%.18
2) The expectation means that every time prices rise, consumers stop buying. They just wait for prices to drop again. Businesses can't raise prices or hire new workers. Employees don't get raises, so they just keep saving.
3) The Bank wants to keep the value of the yen low. But the yen carry trade keeps raising it. Even when the dollar's value soared 15% in 2014, it didn't increase the price of imports. A lower yen normally increases the price of imported commodities, triggering inflation. But plummeting oil prices kept prices low. That made deflation worse.
solutions => Resolution of the Non-Performing Loans Problem -
The first step toward economic revitalization is the definite and final disposal of non-performing loans (NPLs). To achieve this objective, we must facilitate the appropriate disclosure of information about the financial condition of the companies burdened with excessive debts.
Second, the govt. is also planning to monitor the major banks for their progress in clearing their NPLs off their balance sheets, making use of new indicators.
Third, disposal of NPLs will be facilitated by the Resolution and Collection Corporation (RCC), whose functions will be further strengthened in securitization and business restructuring of viable debtor companies .
Fourth, the Govt. providing employment measures to guard against the unwelcomed side-effects of disposing of NPLs. The Govt. is creating employment opportunities in new sectors (for an estimated 5.3 million people within five years for the services sector). The Govt. will encourage mobility in the labor force by supporting self-education community colleges as well as through an occupational ability assessment system, by deregulating temporary personnel markets, and by improving safety nets such as assistance of housing loans and educational burdens for those who are without jobs.
Fifth, the Govt. is  aiming to construct a stable financial system suitable for the 21st century by emphasizing the flow of funds through direct finance, and by achieving banking reforms that will limit the risks of shareholding among banks.

# China
problem 1) Regional imbalances -
The growing wealth gap can be seen as a byproduct of China's economic and social development policies. The adverse effects of having a widening inequity between the rich and the poor include social and political instability, discrimination in access to areas such as public health, education, pensions and unequal opportunities for the Chinese people. It is important to note that the inequality in income in China can also be seen as a rural-urban income gap especially with the widely criticized social development policy, the Hukou (household registration) System in place. Market income – mainly wages – has been the driving factor in shaping urban income inequality since the economic reforms in China while the widening rural-urban income gap is due to low salaries for employees and migrants in many companies coupled with rapidly growing profits for the management of State-owned enterprises, real estate developers and some private companies. The urban per capita net income stood at 17,175 yuan ($2,525) in 2009, in contrast to 5,153 yuan in the countryside, with the urban-to-rural income ratio being 3.33:1, according to figures from the National Bureau of Statistics.
solution =>
The Chinese Govt. is setting up industries in the remote areas so that the remote areas can also develop and different camps from  are also running by the Chinese Govt. to give knowledge to the local citizens about the business they can run in their area and what type of policies and financial help the Chinese Govt. is providing them
Problem 2. Employment =>
Employment distribution has been an important issue for the Chinese Government ever since it began initiating reforms. The previous state-led system of employment has been restructured to accommodate the market economy. Its negative effects include the massive layoffs and the cracks to the household registration system, which sent many rural Chinese to seek employment in the cities. These factors gave rise to the competitive labor force and unemployment. Employment levels differ from region to region, with stronger concentrations of unemployment in the interior.
solution =>
1 ) Governments provide small loans and give interest subsidies to support the businesses and support SME's development for the sake of expanding employment. The government would also establish social security policy to improve the unemployment.
2 Proactive Employment Policy :-
 The government has enacted "Constitution of the People's Republic of China",
"Labor Law of the People's Republic of China," and other relevant laws and
regulations so as to protect the workers' right to employment. It has established the
employment principle of "workers finding their own jobs, employment through
market regulation and employment promoted by the government", and formulated and
implemented a set of proactive employment policies, mainly including:
2.1 Macroeconomic Policies-
The government has always adhered to the principle of expanding domestic
demand, exercises a stable fiscal and monetary policy, actively adjusts the economic
structure and enhances the motive power of economic growth in driving employment;
encourage the development of individual and private economy to expand employment,
vigorously develop the tertiary industry to create employment opportunity.
2.2 Fiscal, Taxation, and Financial Policies - 
Through using favorable taxation policy, providing small loans, giving interest
subsidies, and offering social insurance subsidies and post subsidies, the government
supports the unemployed to realize self-employment or set up their own businesses,
encourage small/medium enterprises to absorb the unemployed.
2.3 Developing non-profit Public Posts - 
The government invested in the development of public posts, through
reemployment assistance, to help the most disadvantaged people to get their jobs.
2.4 Social Security Policy - 
The government has actively explored the establishment of a social security system
independent of enterprises and public institutions, with diversified fund sources,
standardization in security system, and socialization in management and service;
established an unemployment insurance system, and the system of "three guarantees".
2.5 Improving the Public Employment Service System - 
The public employment service agencies at all levels provide free employment
service for the job seekers. For laid-offs and the unemployed, they provide a
"one-stop" service.
2.6 National Vocational Training System - 
 The government pays attention both to school diplomas and vocational
qualification certificates; preliminarily set up the Employment Permission System;
has set up a vocational qualification training system with five levels.
2.7 Unemployment Monitoring Policy - 
By comprehensively using properly legal, economic, and administrative measures,
the government restricts unemployment in origin. “Separation methods” have been
adopted to address the issues of surplus workers in the restructuring of state-owned 
enterprises to avoid massive layoffs.
Problem 3. Crime :-
(1)Increase in corporate irregularity a.k.a. white-collar crime.
(2) Close tie between organized crime and corruption
(3) Increased instances of alleged fraud and scams (including people claiming supernatural powers, quack medicines, etc.)
(4) The resurgence of Chinese organized crime.
solution => The government is planning to increase it's cyber security by adding more employees in it's cyber security department and bringing new technology in the department, with the help of cyber security the Govt. will be keeping an eye on all the political executives to reduce White - collar crime and corruption Problem 3. Gender Discrimination -
In multiple sectors of Chinese society women still face discrimination. First, the employment sector reveals several mechanisms disadvantaging women from an equal position in the work force. Notably, the rising wage gap, the reproduction of stereotypes in job opportunities, the confinement of women to lower paid posts, and the unfair practices of penalizing women for motherhood duties. The gender wage gap remains a tough struggle for China to conquer, with studies showing its continued rise rather than its decline– especially amongst lower income groups. This is partly due to the restricted employment opportunities offered to women– notably, their limitation to lower level administrative and sales jobs–, and to their greater lack of education . Additionally, while men are hired for their experience, women are employed for their youth, height, and attractiveness; consequently, further limiting them to stereotypical career choices. Furthermore, despite it being illegal, employers refuse to recruit women to avoid child bearing costs, or even fire women over their "inefficiency" during pregnancies. Similarly, the family sector reveals countless instances of discrimination against women in China
solution =>
1) Increasing political representation -  More women in positions of political decision-making are creating a role model effect that could encourage more women to enter politics and leadership roles. Countries with higher levels of women in political power have also been found to have higher levels of women in business leadership.
2) Govt. support - The Govt. of China is planning to support women financially by reducing their Medical bills ,etc . To make them independent the Govt. is focusing on the female education as well and many camps are running by Chinese Govt. which give support to women and help them in becoming independent
3) Chinese society has a loud community of women's rights and feminist activists fighting against gender inequalities. Feminists in China speak out on issues of violence against women, employment inequalities, and discriminatory Chinese traditions and policies. Despite Chinese censorship laws, activists remain motivated to challenge gender discrimination, by relying on online social protests. For instance, in 2018 more than 30 million Chinese citizens participated in the #MeToo movement on social media platforms in order to raise awareness against sexual harassment. Thus, the internet has become an important tool for Chinese society to fight against gender discrimination, and eradicate this social issue.
