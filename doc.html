	<p>(Takes camera to the home page) Welcome to The Corporate Raiders, a place to ask for financial advice. This website was made for the UniGlobe hackathon. First, you go to the home page and answer a list of questions so we can get the best data for you. (Answers the questions and proceeds to the information page) Then in this page it tells you everything you need. Remember that only the United States, India, Japan and China are supported right now. (Goes to about page) This page explains everything about our project and explains what each of our team members did. (Proceeds to read every team member name and description)
